## This repo is forked from the official version (expectations)

* I'm adding changes I might make based on how I want to use UWUVCI.
* This fork will not contain releases that are installers, the intent will be building from the source or dropping the exe in the release onto a current installation
* I will not be providing support for this repo, since this is for my personal use and those savvy enough to use it.
* Because of the constant pestering I have been receiving about this repo, I have removed the exe from releases. If you want to use this, you must build from source.
* This fork starts from release "3.Z-Again" of UWUVCI 3.
